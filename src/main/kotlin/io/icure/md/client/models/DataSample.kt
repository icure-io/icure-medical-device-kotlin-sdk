/**
 * A Data Sample represents a medical information, provided by a Data Owner concerning one specific [Patient], for a T moment.       Provided by a Data Owner means that the data sample may have been either provided by a [HealthcareProfessional] or a [Patient], either collected by a [MedicalDevice].         Data Samples provided by the patient include subjective information, such as complaints, reason for visit, feelings, etc. or objective information       like bio-metric measures (blood pressure, temperature, heart beat, etc.), or physical exam description, diagnosis, prescription, integration of lab reports from another [HealthcareProfessional], action plan, etc.      Any action performed by the [HealthcareProfessional] (which is relevant for a [HealthcareElement] of a [Patient]) is considered as a [DataSample].       The data samples can be linked to healthcare elements or other structuring elements of the medical record
 *
 * @param id The Id of the Data sample. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @param transactionId The transactionId is used when a single data sample had to be split into parts for technical reasons. Several data samples with the same non null transaction id form one single data sample
 * @param identifier Typically used for business / client identifiers. An identifier should identify a data sample uniquely and unambiguously. However, iCure can't guarantee the uniqueness of those identifiers : This is something you need to take care of.
 * @param batchId Id of the batch that embeds this data sample
 * @param healthElementsIds List of IDs of all healthcare elements for which the data sample is provided. Only used when the Data sample is emitted outside of its batch
 * @param canvasesIds List of Ids of all canvases linked to the Data sample. Only used when the Data sample is emitted outside of its batch.
 * @param index Used for sorting data samples inside an upper object (A batch, a transaction, a FHIR bundle, ...)
 * @param content Information contained in the data sample (Measure, number, ...). Content is localized, using ISO language code as key
 * @param valueDate The date (YYYYMMDDhhmmss) when the Data sample is noted to have started and also closes on the same date
 * @param openingDate The date (YYYYMMDDhhmmss) of the start of the Data sample
 * @param closingDate The date (YYYYMMDDhhmmss) marking the end of the Data sample
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this data sample in iCure system. Will be filled automatically if not provided.
 * @param modified The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this data sample in iCure system. Will be filled automatically if not provided.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the data sample
 * @param author The id of the [User] that created this data sample. When creating the data sample, will be filled automatically by the current user id if not provided.
 * @param responsible The id of the data owner that is responsible of this data sample. When creating the data sample, will be filled automatically by the current user data owner id ([HealthcareProfessional], [Patient] or [MedicalDevice]) if missing
 * @param comment Text, comments on the Data sample provided
 * @param qualifiedLinks Links towards related data samples (possibly in other batches)
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this data sample. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param labels A label is an item from a codification system that qualifies a data sample as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the label qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the label will always apply. LOINC is a codification system typically used for labels.
